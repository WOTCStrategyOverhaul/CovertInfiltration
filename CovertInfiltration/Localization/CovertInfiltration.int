Instead, opportunities will appear in the Covert Ops menu, accessible from the button at the bottom of the screen. You can send out as many squads as you wish, but be aware that new opportunities may appear at any time and that ADVENT can and will initiate retaliations against your havens!"

strCovertActionLoadoutHeader="Changes to Covert Actions"
strCovertActionLoadoutBody="Traditional Covert Actions still involve you sending out soldiers into the unknown, but there are a few major changes. First, the time to complete them is now dependent on your soldiers' gear. A properly equipped squad will complete them more quickly.<br/>Secondly, you also have to watch out for the squad's deterrence, which affects the trigger chance of risks. Deterrence increased by sending more experienced soldiers and giving them better gear.<br/>Balance out infiltration and deterrence to complete Covert Actions successfully!"

strInfiltrationSelectionHeader="Infiltration Missions"
strInfiltrationSelectionBody="The activity you selected is an Infiltration. These missions have you equipping a full squad in preparation for tactical combat. You have to deploy a minimum amount of soldiers up to the normal squadsize, and can choose to deploy additional soldiers in overload slots, which lead to a penalty to infiltration speed and max infiltration. Squadsize upgrades in the GTS will remove the penalties on these slots.<br/>Once deployed, the squad will infiltrate the mission site over time, at a speed that depends on their infiltration rating. To start tactical combat, the infiltration has to reach 100%.<br/>You are also able to overinfiltrate a mission, editing the mission's SITREPs after each additional 33% of infiltration. Overinfiltration is recommended for inexperienced squads or risky missions, but isn't necessary to complete every mission."

strCovertActionFinishedHeader="Fatigue from Covert Actions"
strCovertActionFinishedBody="Just like missions, Covert Actions will also have an effect on your soldiers' willpower. If they end up tired they won't be able to deploy on another Covert Action until they have recovered.<br/>While Covert Actions can be an easy way to gain benefits, you should be careful about how many you attempt at any given time. Deploying lots of soldiers will leave you exposed when other more time-critical missions appear, and not all Covert Actions are worth the risks."

strFacilityChangesHeader="Facility Changes"
strFacilityChangesBody="The Resistance Ring is no longer needed to prepare Covert Actions - instead, building it unlocks Resistance Orders. Once the Ring is built, you will be able to assign orders instantly, without waiting for a supply drop.<br/>You are now limited in how many personnel you can maintain at once by the Barracks Limit. For each soldier, scientist, or engineer over the limit, will recovery times are increased by 10%. The limit can be increased via upgrades in the Living Quarters.<br/>In addition, the GTS now has 2 rookie training slots."

strActivityChainsHeader="Activity Chains"
strActivityChainsBody="An activity chain is a set of missions and/or covert actions that yields big rewards. They will be presented to you by the resistance and as your network grows more opportunities will be revealed.<br/>While the main reward(s) are usually given at the end of the chain, the earlier missions are still beneficial for XP and loot even if you don't intend to finish the chain."
