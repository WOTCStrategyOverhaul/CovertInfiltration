strGeoscapeEntryHeader=Proactive Deployment
strGeoscapeEntryBody="<Bullet/> In Covert Infiltration, most missions will no longer appear automatically on the geoscape. Instead, opportunities will appear in the Covert Ops menu, accessible from the button at the bottom of the screen.<br/><Bullet/> You can send out squads on as many ops as you wish but be aware that new opportunities may appear at any time and that ADVENT can and will initiate retaliations against your havens!<br/><Bullet/> Don't forget that in Operation Gatecrasher, your squad rescued an Engineer and Scientist from ADVENT's clutches. They can be put to work immediately.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, as your strategic advisor, I would recommend sending out a few teams immediately for whatever operations are available. However, don't go overboard. We should always keep a squad or two in reserve to deal with any unexpected situations!</i>"

strCrewLimitHeader=Crew Limit
strCrewLimitBody="<Bullet/> Onboard the Avenger, space is precious, but everyone needs their own bed for optimal recovery. You are limited in how many personnel can be maintained at once by the crew limit.<br/><Bullet/> Every soldier, scientist, and engineer counts towards the limit - other crewmembers are not counted. Robotic units such as SPARKs or some units from other mods do not count towards the limit.<br/><Bullet/> For each person over the limit, the will recovery time for all soldiers is increased by 10%. These penalties can quickly become crippling and all efforts should be made to avoid exceeding the limit.<br/><Bullet/> The Crew Limit can be increased via upgrades in the Living Quarters (the room below the Commander's Quarters). These upgrades are resource and power intensive.<br/><Bullet/> The current status of the crew limit is visible in the top right corner of the screen in the Living Quarters, Recruiting, and on the Geoscape.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, the consequences for overloading the Avenger are severe. We should plan ahead to ensure that each person has their own bunk as we expand our forces.</i>"

strCovertActionLoadoutHeader=Covert Actions
strCovertActionLoadoutBody="<Bullet/> Covert Actions are the simplest type of activity. A team of soldiers is sent for a specified duration, and they return with rewards. The duration is determined by a base duration plus extra time based on the number of soldiers and equipment sent.<br/><Bullet/> Covert Actions will (usually) never result in tactical combat. Equipping the team with equipment such as specialized grenades or medikits is a waste of resources, unless there is a risk of ambush.<br/><Bullet/> However, upgraded weapons and armour will decrease the chance of risks triggering. A rough estimate of the trigger chance of each risk is shown on the right side of the squad select screen. A squad that is equipped with heavier or higher-tier items will be more likely to come home safe.<br/><Bullet/> As the aliens continue to improve their armies and bring in reinforcements from offworld, they will also ramp up their patrols and security efforts. Covert Action risk chances will steadily increase as time goes on, so at some point purely conventional gear isn't going to cut it.<br/>"

strInfiltrationLoadoutHeader=Infiltration Missions
strInfiltrationLoadoutBody="<Bullet/> Infiltration missions have you equipping a full squad in preparation for tactical combat. Once deployed, the squad will need to spend time at the mission site for a duration that depends on the number of soldiers and their gear.<br/><Bullet/>Generally, each type of item has the same infil duration no matter its tech level. Instead, choose lighter armour and smaller weapons to minimize the squad's infil duration. There are exceptions to these rules, such as Psi Amps or Disguises, which become better with tech level.<br/><Bullet/> Adding additional soldiers into the two optional slots will incur major penalties to the infil duration. These penalties can be removed through upgrades in the Guerilla Tactics School.<br/><Bullet/> To start tactical combat, the squad must prepare for at least the listed infiltration duration. However, a variety of bonuses can be gained through overinfiltration, where the squad prepares beyond 100% and up to 250% of the listed duration.<br/><Bullet/> Risks can NOT be reduced through fielding better gear, unlike Covert Actions. Instead, if a risk activates it can be removed later on through overinfiltration.<br/>"

strOverInfiltrationHeader=Overinfiltration
strOverInfiltrationBody="<Bullet/> The infiltrating squad has prepared enough to launch the mission now. However, you are also able to overinfiltrate a mission, editing the mission's SITREPs after each additional 25% of infiltration up to 250%.<br/><Bullet/> Overinfiltration is recommended for difficult missions or inexperienced squads but isn't necessary to complete every mission.<br/><Bullet/> The chance that one of the Elders' Chosen will catch wind of our operation and show up to stop us will be reduced through continued infiltration.<br/><Bullet/> For more information about the squad's overinfiltration progress, click the yellow question mark button on the rightmost UI element.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, overinfiltration can be a worthwhile process for difficult missions. However, every day we spend waiting is one more day that the squad is unavailable for another operation. If we believe the squad can handle the mission as is, I recommend going in as soon as possible.</i>"

strAssaultLoadoutHeader=Assault Missions
strAssaultLoadoutBody="<Bullet/> Assault missions are what you are used to from basegame XCOM 2, where the squad flies in the Skyranger to tactical combat and then returns immediately.<br/><Bullet/> Unlike infiltration missions and covert actions, infil time and risk negation are not in play. You may bring as many soldiers and as much gear as the Skyranger can carry with no penalties.<br/><Bullet/> Beware, Assault missions are typically more difficult than the average Infiltration. More enemies will be present and the squad will not have control over the mission site's SitReps.<br/>"

strCovertActionFinishedHeader=Fatigue from Covert Actions
strCovertActionFinishedBody="<Bullet/> Just like missions, Covert Actions will affect your soldiers' willpower. If they lose too much will and end up tired, they won't be able to deploy on another Covert Action until they have recovered.<br/><Bullet/> While Covert Actions can be an easy way to gain rewards, you should be careful about how many you attempt at any given time. Not all Covert Actions are worth the risks.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, we'll need to pick our targets carefully. Deploying lots of soldiers will leave us exposed when other more time-critical missions appear.</i>"

strFacilityRingHeader=Resistance Ring Changes
strFacilityRingBody="<Bullet/> The Resistance Ring is no longer needed to prepare Covert Actions - instead, building it unlocks Resistance Orders and a variety of upgrades.<br/><Bullet/> When the Ring is built, you will be able to assign orders instantly. This can only be done once and afterwards you will need to wait for a supply drop as normal.<br/><Bullet/> The Guerilla Tactics School has also been tweaked, but it's core function remains intact. A tutorial to explain more will appear when you build it.<br/>"

strFacilityGTSHeader=Guerilla Tactics School Changes
strFacilityGTSBody="<Bullet/> The Guerilla Tactics School now has 2 training slots, and instead of training Rookies to Squaddies it now has a Training Rank value. Any soldier under that rank can be staffed to train up to the Training Rank. The current Training Rank can be seen in the top right.<br/><Bullet/> The time required to train a soldier is multiplied based on how many ranks under the Training Rank they are.<br/><Bullet/> If the staffed soldier is a Rookie, you may choose which class they will be promoted to. Training a soldier from Rookie to Squaddie takes slightly longer than other rank increases.<br/><Bullet/> The Training Rank starts at Squaddie but can be increased to Corporal and Sergeant through a Resistance Order and an upgrade in the Guerrilla Tactics School.<br/>"

strActivityChainsHeader=Activity Chains
strActivityChainsBody="<Bullet/> An Activity Chain is a set of activities that must be completed in sequence to gain a large reward at the end of the chain. These activities can include Assault Missions, Covert Infiltrations, and Covert Actions.<br/><Bullet/> While the main reward(s) are usually given at the end of the chain, the earlier missions are still beneficial for XP and loot and often include secondary rewards. <br/><Bullet/> Activity Chain stages are semi-randomized, the structure of each chain and the final stage is usually the same but the mission types and rewards of the prep stages will be varied.<br/><Bullet/> Activity Chains are discovered over time by Resistance Informants and presented to XCOM for analysis. For more info, click the View Chain button at the top of the screen.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, we don't have the luxury of hitting ADVENT's big targets right away. We'll need to gather intel and distract the enemy before moving in on our main objective.</i>"

strResistanceInformantsHeader=Resistance Informants
strResistanceInformantsBody="<Bullet/> In the top right corner of this screen, you can see the current number of Informants. These resistance sympathizers, hidden in ADVENT controlled areas, are the key to XCOM's global operations.<br/><Bullet/> Informants gather data and report back to XCOM, revealing new opportunities for our soldiers to investigate. With our current number, you can expect our informants to uncover a new activity chain about every two weeks.<br/><Bullet/> The ADVENT administration in this region is already completely penetrated. If you want to increase the number of resistance Informants at your disposal, you will need to contact new regions or build more radio relays.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, we should make extending the Resistance Network a high priority. Without ADVENT targets to hit, we will run low on essential supplies and deprive the troops of fighting experience.</i>"

strFacilityAssaultsHeader=Assaulting Avatar Facilities
strFacilityAssaultsBody="<Bullet/> Hidden facilities supporting the Avatar should be a major target for XCOM. However, a direct assault is suicide given the reinforcements ADVENT can bring to bear. Facilities must be jammed before they can be safely attacked.<br/><Bullet/> Actionable Leads are gained by researching Facility Leads, which can be acquired by capturing Avatar Coordinators, scanning sites, or random hack rewards. If you hold at least one Actionable Lead, any facility in the world can be targeted.<br/><Bullet/> Actionable Leads are spent to attempt, not unlock, facilities. If the assault fails, the Actionable Lead will still be consumed. If you are in dire need of an Actionable Lead, one is always available in the Black Market, but it will not show up again once purchased.<br/><Bullet/> Alternatively, there is another method to assault a facility. If a radio relay is built in the facility's region, that facility will be permanently unlocked. Simply contacting the region is not sufficient.<br/><Bullet/> The amount of Actionable Leads you currently possess can be seen in the top right of the screen when you click on an Avatar Facility (provided it is located in a region without a radio relay).<br/>"

strAdvancedChainsHeader=Expanding the Resistance
strAdvancedChainsBody="<Bullet/> The aliens are continuously improving their forces. For XCOM to keep up, they need a steady flow of resources that may be difficult to obtain through Supply Transfer missions and the commonly found small intel rewards.<br/><Bullet/> Building at least one Radio Relay in any contacted region will unlock new Advanced Chains that will allow XCOM to launch highly rewarding attacks on Supply Convoys and ADVENT Collaborators<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, we can't win this war with small attacks. We need to hit ADVENT where it hurts, and that means expanding the Resistance Network through contacts and relays, ASAP.</i>"

strDarkEventsHeader=Countering Dark Events
strDarkEventsBody="<Bullet/> ADVENT has only just begun its counterinsurgency operations. While there is only a single Dark Event this month, ADVENT will accelerate their efforts and eventually bring three against us each month.<br/><Bullet/> The resistance will investigate and prepare Activity Chains to neutralize each Dark Event, but their intelligence is limited. Each region you have contacted will be sufficient to discover one random Dark Event each month.<br/><Bullet/> This means that if you control two regions, and ADVENT prepares three Dark Events, only two of them will be available to be countered. Furthermore, those two may not be the ones you wish to counter.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, now that ADVENT knows we possess the Avenger, they'll be ramping up their efforts to destroy us. We should expand the resistance network so that we can discover and neutralize any enemy operation.</i>"

strCovertOpsAbortHeader=Aborting Covert Ops
strCovertOpsAbortBody="<Bullet/> Once a Covert Operation has begun, the team enters radio silence to avoid ADVENT detection. Contacting them and bringing them home will become more difficult the deeper they venture into ADVENT territory.<br/><Bullet/> After a certain point, the intel cost to locate and extract a team may become high enough that you should simply let them complete their mission and return home.<br/><Bullet/> In the case of Covert Infiltrations, sometimes the best course of action is to let them infiltrate to 100% and begin their mission, then send the Skyranger to evacuate them. However, this method is not viable all the time, as the pickup zone is preplaced in some mission types.<br/><br/>BRADFORD'S RECOMMENDATION: <i>Commander, we need to think ahead when considering our deployments. If we suddenly need a squad in an emergency, it's cheaper to cancel an operation that's in the early stages compared to one that has been underway for a while.</i>"
