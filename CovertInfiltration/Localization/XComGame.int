As expected, the data includes specifications on the security protocols for all of ADVENT's remote facilities. With this knowledge in hand, we should be able to deploy signal jammers and send in a strike team to assault and destroy the facility. However, ADVENT will surely switch their encryption methods once they figure out what's going on. This information is only useful to us for one strike. But I have no doubts that if we can pull it off, the loss of a facility will deal a significant blow to the aliens' efforts towards the Avatar Project. R. Tygan."
