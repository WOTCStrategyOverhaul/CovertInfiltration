BriefSummary="These suits of civilian clothing can serve as disguises for our operatives in the field. They will make our soldiers harder for ADVENT to detect, but provide no protection whatsoever."
TacticalText="<Bullet/> The Civilian Disguise makes a soldier harder to detect by enemy forces and shortens infiltration time.\n<Bullet/> However, this disguise is paper thin. Soldiers wearing it should avoid heavy engagements if possible, using their enhanced mobility and stealth."

BriefSummary="The data gleaned from ADVENT's neural implants allows us to pass soldiers off as ADVENT troopers. Surveillance systems will be utterly fooled thanks to the neural transponder, but actual enemies may be less convinced."
TacticalText="<Bullet/> The ADVENT Disguise makes a soldier much harder to detect by enemy forces and shortens infiltration time.\n<Bullet/> The transponders of this disguise render the user invisible to ADVENT security towers.\n<Bullet/> The mixture of alien alloy and steel used by ADVENT provides increased protection over civilian disguises, but no mobility bonus."
