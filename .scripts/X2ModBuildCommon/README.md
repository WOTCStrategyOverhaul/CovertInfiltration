# X2ModBuildCommon
An improved XCOM 2 mod building toolchain

# State of the project
This project is based on [robojumper's original build_common.ps1](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/pull/933/files#diff-b373d411bcf9e8c0d6ac068c9fd3c24571c3032fa1134ece9de0fb7d3d595ad3) and is currently WIP. The plan:

* Integration of [xymanek's mod asset cooking functionality](https://github.com/WOTCStrategyOverhaul/CovertInfiltration/compare/d3fedb5f2123%5E...1539e1608ca9#diff-dde044f867a342d7ec2878e4d9d70024f46576218dc84e879f79339f2a726b5c)
* Integration into CHL/CI/etc as a git submodule
* Documentation for general usage by mod authors based on the experiences from the previous step
* Documentation of the mod asset cooking functionality
